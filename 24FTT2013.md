1. Check requirements

We need to install the following packages:
- PHP
- Composer
- MYSQL

Check by running the following commands:
```
bash

php -v
composer -V
mysql -V
```

2. Set up Github repository.

Initialise Git on your local project folder.
```
bash

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
```
**Note:** The 2nd and 3rd commands are there to make sure our Machine Spirit (local repository) does not have conflicts when we push to the Omnissiah (remote repository).


Go to your Github and create a new repo. Then copy the URL link to clipboard so that we can paste it in;
```
bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/EdisonPhoon/Asg2_NEP_Edison_DCNG03.git
git push -u origin main
```
**Note:** `-u` stands for `--setup-upstream`.
