# Logbook
*By: Edison Phoon Tek Wei*


## Session 15/09/2025

### 1. Check requirements

To recreate this project, we need to have the following installed:
- Laravel Breeze (for authentication template)
- DBNgin (to create MySQL server)
- PHP v8.4 or higher
- npm and node.js
- TablePlus
- Composer

To see full installation, see Appendix A.

To check for version of each, run these commands:
```
bash

php -v
composer -V
node -v
```

### 2. Create Laravel project.

Run this command to order the Laravel to install itself and navigate to the folder:
```
bash

composer create-project laravel/laravel Asg2_NEP_Edison_DCNG03
cd Asg2_NEP_Edison_DCNG03
```

### 3. Using Git

Git is useful for its version control. Initialise it inside project folder with these commands in powershell:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
```

Type `git add` or `git add .` (for selecting *all files*) to have changes move to stage. Then type `git commit` to commit changes. This is to enable reverting to a previous version instead of *undoing* all changes which loses days of work. Best practice is to do this everytime a code/file is working fine in meaningful way. 

Now occassionally, we would need to push our local repo to GitHub for backup, version control and maybe collaboration if this was a live project. So we create a new repo on GitHub itself and copy the URL. We take that URL and type this command in powershell to establish a link:

```
git remote add origin <URL>
```

Now that we have a remote repo, we can either push or pull changes. To push changes, type:
```
git push -u origin main
```

To pull changes, type:
```
git pull origin main
```

Now I set up my global config so that I don't have to type my name and email everytime I commit - GitHub can track who made what changes.

Here are the commands used:
```
git config --global user.name "Edison Phoon"
git config --global user.email "24FTT2013@student.pb.edu.bn"
```
To check if it was successful, type:
```
git config --global --list
```
Keep on holding any key until end of the list is reached where any key can be pressed to exit.

If I wanted to make a new branch to ensure any commits would not affect the main branch, I would type:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
git branch <branch-name>
git checkout <branch-name>
```

To list all branches, type:
```
git branch --list
```

But to merge a branch to main to clear up clutter, I would type:
```
git checkout main
git merge <branch-name>
```

Now I should clarify good practice is to run `git fetch` command to synchronise local repo with remote repo before merging. Otherwise this will result in a conflict error. And we don't want that - if have this problem then see to Appendix C *as an example* based on experience in this logbook. For all intents and purposes, normally if we are only looking to take "copy" of the changes from remote repo, we would use `git pull` command.

To delete a branch, type:
```
git branch -d <branch-name>
```


### 4. Start MySQL Database


Create a server in DBNingin with any name assigned. In this developer's case, the server is named "Edison's Server".

Then open with TablePlus, use the `Ctrl K` keybind to *create a database* named "a2p". 

Update the `.env` file to have the following configurations:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=a2p
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Note that; NEVER put *any other* username neither assign a password - as the "Edison's Server" was assigned by default to have a username of "root" with NO password.

If unable connect to TablePlus with shown config, see Appendix B.

### 5. Create Migration

A migration is a system that creates and modifies our database by code instead of manually.  

Create a migration file with this command in powershell:

```
bash

php artisan make:migration create_games_table --create=games
```

Note that a good practice in Laravel is to name migration files as `create_<name>_table` I.E. `create_books_table` to state its function.

Inside `database/migrations`, head to recently created file. We need to define the schema in the `up()` function. It should resemble something like this.

```
public function up(): void
{
    Schema::create('games', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('name');
        $table->string('genre');
        $table->integer('rating');
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

This migration will not show up in TablePlus until `php artisan migrate` is typed in powershell.


### 6. Create Seeding

We have the "blueprint" (schema) for our table but it's empty. We fill it with data via a seeding file.

Go ahead and create one with this command in powershell.

```
php artisan make:seeder GamesTableSeeder
```

Now to `database/seeders`, then our recently created file. We need to define the `run()` function *and* import facades. So it resemble something like this

```
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

public function run(): void
{
    DB::table('games')->insert([
        [
        'name' => 'Minecraft', 
        'genre' => 'Sandbox', 
        'rating' => 7, 
        'created_at' => now(), 
        'updated_at' => now()
        ]
    ]);
}
```

Apply the seeder by typing in powershell:
```
php artisan db:seed --class=GamesTableSeeder
```

Since this developer isn't using Eloquent model via `php artisan make:model Game`, Laravel will not generate *created_at* and *updated_at* columns (timestamps).

To solve this, the solution is to use `now()` method at the schema for "created_at" and "updated_at" columns.


### 7. Model

A model is, in layman's terms, the "data" itself inside a table. While seeding is the process of inserting that data into the table. There are two ways to automate seeding process, *manually* and *mass assignment*. Mass assignment enables multiple data columns to be filled at all once.

To a create a model, type this command in powershell:

```
php artisan make:model Game
```

Now to `app/Models`, to recently created file. Add a `$fillable` property to enable mass assignment as well as to prevent mass assignment vulnerability error. It should resemble something like this:

```
protected $fillable = ['name', 'genre', 'rating'];
```

To apply model, we can use `php artisan tinker` command with the following to insert a record;
```
Game::create(['name' => 'ULTRAKILL', 'genre' => 'FPS', 'rating' => 8]);
```

To apply we use `php artisan serve` command. If encounter error "Failed to listen on 127.0.0.1:8000 (reason: ?)", see Appendix B.


## Session 16/09/2025


### 8. Controller

A controller is a medium that connects route to model. Without it, we cannot access model via route. To create a controller, we use this command:
```
bash

php artisan make:controller GameController
```

### 9. Controller Defining -> CRUD 

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. 

To save time and avoid human error, I used the command `php artisan make:controller GameController --resource --model=Game` - this generates a controller with all CRUD functions and linked to the "Game" model. Although each function still required defining.

It should resembling like this:

```
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Game;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class GameController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     */
    public function index()
    {
        $game = Game::all();
        return view('games.index', compact('game'));
    }

    /**
     * Show the form for creating a new resource.
     */
    public function create()
    {
        return view('games.create');
    }

    /**
     * Store a newly created resource in storage.
     */
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $validated = $request->validate([
            'name' => 'required|string|max:30',
            'genre' => 'required|string|max:30',
            'rating' => 'required|numeric|min:0|max:10',
        ])
    }

    /**
     * Display the specified resource.
     */
    public function show(Game $game)
    {
        return view('games.show', compact('game'));
    }

    /**
     * Show the form for editing the specified resource.
     */
    public function edit(Game $game)
    {
        return view('games.edit', compact('game'));
    }

    /**
     * Update the specified resource in storage.
     */
    public function update(Request $request, Game $game)
    {
        $validated = $request->validate([
            'name' => 'required|string|max:30',
            'genre' => 'required|string|max:30',
            'rating' => 'required|numeric|min:0|max:10',
        ]);

        $game->update($validated);

        return redirect()->route('game.index')
                         ->with('success', 'Game updated successfully.');
    }

    /**
     * Remove the specified resource from storage.
     */
    public function destroy(Game $game)
    {
        $game->delete();
        
        return redirect()->route('game.index')  
                         ->with('success', 'Game deleted successfully.');
    }
}
```


### 10. Add New Route

If we use an analogy; A route is like a road that tells traffic (our HTTP request) where to go. A controller is the traffic police that decides what to do with the incoming requests. A model is the end destination that the traffic is heading to.

But for now, our controller has no route to go to. We define one with a `resource` route which removes the need to manually define route for each CRUD function. 

Go to `routes/web.php` and add this line at the bottom:

```
Route::resource('games', GameController::class);
```

### 11. Custom Views

To get the views I created a folder named `games` inside `resources/views` folder. 

Then I created the following files:
- index.blade.php
- create.blade.php
- edit.blade.php
- show.blade.php

### 12. Use the Template System

To avoid repeating the same thing over and over again, we use the use the template system. 

But to clarify, first page anyone will see is the Laravel default `welcome.blade.php` page. To see full changes, see Appendix F.

I created a `game` folder inside `resources/views` folder. Then created a file named `index.blade.php` inside it.

I asked DeepSeek to create me a HTML structure in Blade template format. It looks something like this:

```

### 13. Implement Views for CRUD Functions

After setting up a template, I then extended it to each view file. We need one for "Create", "Read", "Update" and "Delete" functions.

So we should have files in Step 11 as follows:
- create.blade.php
- show.blade.php
- edit.blade.php
- index.blade.php (acts as both "show" function as well as layout for other views)

Just to note, make sure that your `index.blade.php` file is spelled with lowercase "I" if you did put `index.blade.php` in the route, to avoid "View not found" error. For the `index.blade.php`, it acts as both the "show" function as well as layout for other views. 

Note that most of them use ChatGPT to generate the code.

For the `index.blade.php` file, it was already shown above in the template system section.

For the `show.blade.php` file, it looks something like this:

```
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('title', 'Game Details')

@section('content')
<div class="container">
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-header">
                    <h2>Game Details</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    @if($game)

</div>
@endsection
```

For the `update.blade.php` file, does not have a blade template as it's handled by a function in the `GameController.php` file.


### 14. Implement Static Assets

To have an image show up, I created new directory in my folder with these commands:

```
mkdir -p public/images/games
mkdir -p public/images/dashboard
```

I place my images as .png files inside the `games` folder. 

The `dashboard` folder is meant for the dashboard itself and proof that this step was successful.

### 15. Implement Authentication

Note that this was an optional step on my part since anyone can access the site without logging in by clicking on the "See actual page, YES?" button. 

As proof that anyone can get in without logging in, see to Appendix E.

But I wanted to try it out and due to some miscommunication. In the end as part of the requirement, I still have Breeze installed. Since I had Breeze installed, the authentication system and buttons were already set up and showed up in the dashboard (which is first anyone will see). Before anyone is allowed to be redirected to the actual page by clicking on the "See actual page, YES?" button, they must login or register first.

On the live page; Click on either login or register button to be redirected to the respective page. These two are automatically generated by Breeze.

The reason why no-one can "brute-force" their way, through clicking on the "See actual page, YES?" button to be allowed in, is because of the `auth` middleware in `routes/web.php` file.

```
Route::get('/protected-games', function () {
    return redirect()->route('games.index');
})->middleware('auth')->name('protected.games');

Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
    return view('dashboard');
})->middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->name('dashboard');
```

And it's reflected in the `welcome.blade.php` file as follows:

```
<a href="{{ route('protected.games') }}" class="btn btn-dark">
```

This works together with this authentication section in the same file:

```
@if (Route::has('login'))
<nav class="flex items-center justify-end gap-4">
    @auth
        <span class="me-3">Welcome, {{ auth()->user()->name }}</span>
        <a
            href="{{ url('/dashboard') }}"
            class="btn btn-primary"
        >
            Dashboard
        </a>
        <form action="{{ route('logout') }}" method="POST" class="d-inline">
            @csrf
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger btn-sm">Logout</button>
        </form>
    @else
        <a
            href="{{ route('login') }}"
            class="btn btn-primary"
        >
            Log in (Here)
        </a>
        @if (Route::has('register'))
            <a
                href="{{ route('register') }}"
                class="btn btn-secondary"
            >
                Register (IF NOT YET)
            </a>
        @endif
    @endauth
</nav>
```

Now I may be done using the site, and I would like to logout. So I would click on the "Logout" button which is handled here at the `index.blade.php` file:

```
@auth
    <span class="me-3">Welcome, {{ auth()->user()->name }}</span>
    <form action="{{ route('logout') }}" method="POST" class="d-inline">
        @csrf
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger btn-sm">Logout</button>
    </form>
@endauth
```

### 16. Alert Session (Redirect after Login, Register or Logout)

Now we need a way to alert us of any successful or failed actions (login, register or logout). This is for tracking which and when user perform such actions.


In the `welcome.blade.php` file, at the footer of the code, we add this code:

```
@if (session('status'))
        <div class="alert alert-success text-center my-3">
            {{ session('status') }}
        </div>
    @endif
```

Then we make adjustments to the `dashboard.blade.php` file to resemble like this:

```
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
<div class="container">
    <h1>Welcome to your Dashboard!</h1>
    <p>You are logged in.</p>
    <a href="{{ route('games.index') }}" class="btn btn-primary">Go to Games</a>
</div>
@endsection
```

We reflect this in the `routes/web.php` file as follows:

```
Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
    return redirect()->route('games.index');
})->middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->name('dashboard');
```

Now to make sure our authentication will redirect us to the `index.blade.php` file after login or register, not the default `/dashboard` page. Problem is that we are using Breeze which has its own `AuthenticatedSessionController.php` file instead of a `RouteServiceProvider.php` file. So changes should resemble like this:

```
public function store(LoginRequest $request): RedirectResponse
{
    $request->authenticate();

    $request->session()->regenerate();

    return redirect('/games');
}
```

## Appendix A 

Installation of *Breeze*

1) If you have a pre-existing Laravel project, run `composer require laravel/breeze --dev` command which installs the Breeze package.

2) Run `php artisan breeze:install` command to publish resources to your project folder. 

3) Run `php artisan migrate` to apply migration.

Installation of *npm*

1) Type `npm install` command which installs the npm package. 

2) Run `npm run dev` to compile all assets.


## Appendix B

Context: All of these errors and solutions under this appendix are grouped together for completeness sake.

1) [DEPRECATED] Error -> `Driver error 20002: Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1'`

Status: Resolved at (D) Error [NEWEST]

Solution [DEPRECATED] -> Let the Omnimessiah guide your way to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` and make changes as following below. After that, restart by re-attempting to connect in TablePlus.
```
plaintext

127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
```

2) [SUPERCEDED] Error -> You still cannot connect to the database.

Status: Resolved at (D) Error [NEWEST]

Solution [SUPERCEDED] -> Open up your own development MySQL Server to circumvent the issue. Here's the rough list of configurations and steps:
```
plaintext

Choose Setup Type => Custom
MYSQL Server => Will be installed on local hard drive
Client Programs => Will be installed on local hard drive
Development Components => (No need to enable since you are using TablePlus)
Server Configuration Type => Development Computer
Port = 3306
X Protocol Port = 33060
Enable TCP/IP Networking => (You must enable this)
User account & Password => (You create your own here, just remember to update the .env file accordingly)
```
And here's the `.env` file configuration:
```
plaintext

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=a2p
DB_USERNAME=test
DB_PASSWORD=admin@12345678
```

3) [SUPERCEDED] Error -> ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on localhost (10061)

Status: Resolved at (D) Error [NEWEST]

Solution [SUPERCEDED] -> Make sure that MySQL server is running with the command `netstat -ano | findstr :3306`. If nothing shows up, start the server with `net start MySQL80` with Powershell as administrator. If this still does not work, then pray to the Machine God that the solution to Error (B) works if you haven't tried yet.

4)[NEWEST] Error -> You cannot connect to the database with TablePlus

Solution [NEWEST] -> 

1) Uninstall mySQL server on your desktop to avoid port conflicts.

2) Close all DBngin servers then create a new server with simply putting a name and leaving everything else as default. 

3) Install `npm` and `breeze` with the following commands:
```
bash

npm install
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
```

3) Create a new server on DBNgin. Then, go to TablePlus and create a new connection with the following configuration:
```
plaintext

Name = AP2
Host/IP = 127.0.0.1
Port = 3306
User = root
Password = 
Database = 
```
**Note:** You MUST use `root` as the username and leave the password blank as that's DBNgin's default config. Do not have spaces in the `name` field to avoid future problems. Make sure to have the `.env` file reflect this change.

After saving and testing the connection, head to **Show Database List** via "Ctrl + K" and create a new database named `a2p` and open it. Your **table** dropdown tab should contain a list of database tables including the `games` table. If you don't see it, try refreshing the database and MAKE SURE you apply migration with `php artisan migrate` command.

(D) Error -> Failed to listen on 127.0.0.1:8000 (reason: ?)

Solution ->
```
cd public
php -S localhost:8000
``` 
Exit terminal with `Ctrl C` keybind when done.

Note to have Laravel Herd running in the background to ensure the PHP server is running.

(E) Error -> This site can’t be reached.

Solution -> Make sure to have Laravel Herd running in the background alongside running `php -S localhost:8000` command in the `public` folder.

### Appendix C

(A) Error: Git conflict when trying to push to GitHub

Context: I made a new repo on Github and tried to push my local repo to GitHub.

Solution:

1) Type `git status` to see which files are conflicting.

2) Manually resolve each conflict in every conflicting file.

3) After resolving type these in powershell:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
git pull origin main --rebase
```

(B) Error -> git rebase origin/main 
fatal: rebase already in progress (rebase-merge directory exists).

Solution

1) Type these in powershell:
```
git rebase --continue
rm -fr .git/rebase-merge
```

2) Type this to check the remote URL:
```
git remote -v
```
Output should be something like this:
```
origin  https://github.com/EdisonPhoon/old-repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/EdisonPhoon/old-repo.git (push)
```

3) Update the remote URL to new repo
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/EdisonPhoon/NEP_AS1_V1.git
```

4) Verify new remote URL
```
git remote -v
```

5) Push to Github
```
git push -u origin main
```

### Appendix E

Proof that anyone can get in without logging in by clicking on the "See actual page, YES?" button.

In the `welcome.blade.php` file, the button is handled here:

```
<li>
    <a href="{{ route('games.index') }}" class="btn btn-dark">
        See actual page, YES?
    </a>
</li>
```

And to make sure that the route does not force authentication, we make sure that the `auth` middleware is NOT present in the `routes/web.php` file as follows:

```
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'edit'])->name('profile.edit');
    Route::patch('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'update'])->name('profile.update');
    Route::delete('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'destroy'])->name('profile.destroy');

    Route::get('/protected-games', function () {
        return redirect()->route('games.index');
    })->name('protected.games');
});
```

### Appendix F

Here is full changes made to the `welcome.blade.php` file to reflect the dashboard changes. Note that the changes are minimal - removing static images and adding buttons and redirect routes:

```
