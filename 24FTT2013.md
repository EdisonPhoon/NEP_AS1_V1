### Session 05/09/2025

## 1. Check requirements

We need to install the following packages:
- PHP
- Composer
- MYSQL

Check by running the following commands:
```
bash

php -v
composer -V
mysql -V
```

## 2. Set up Laravel project.

Run this command to order the Laravel to install itself and navigate to the folder:
```
bash

composer create-project laravel/laravel Asg2_NEP_Edison_DCNG03
cd Asg2_NEP_Edison_DCNG03
```

## 3. Set up Github repository.

We may need to have a backup of this folder and its contents, hence the need for version control with Git and Github. Initialise Git on your local project folder with this command:
```
bash

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
```
**Note:** The 2nd and 3rd commands are there to make sure our Machine Spirit (local repository) does not have conflicts when we push to the Omnissiah (remote repository).


Go to your Github and create a new repo. Then copy the URL link to clipboard so that we can paste it in;
```
bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/EdisonPhoon/Asg2_NEP_Edison_DCNG03.git
git push -u origin main
```
**Note:** `-u` stands for `--setup-upstream`.

## 4. Set Up Database

We will be using TablePlus to view the sacred MYSQL database. Because of that, we require DBNingin to create a server for TablePlus to connect to. The tricky problem is usually our `.env` file which requires the `DB_` (database) flags to have correct configurations lest the Omnissiah be displeased and our connection to the database fails.

In our `.env` file, we need to set up to this configuration:
```
plaintext

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=a2p
DB_USERNAME=test
DB_PASSWORD=admin@12345
```
Here since we have set up our MySQL server as `AP2`, we must correspond it in our `.env` file. Then we must do the same thing to our TablePlus by *creating new connection* with MySQL and following the configuration from above.

*If we cannot connect with the above configuration even with replacing `127.0.0.1` with "localhost", see to Appendix A.*

## 5. Migration

Migration is a system *blessed by the Omnissiah* to enable the creation and modification of databases. We initiate such task by running this command, where if successful, a migration file will be *summoned* in the `database/migrations` folder.
```
bash

php artisan make:migration create_games_table --create=games
```
Take note that in the catheral realm of Laravel, best practice is to name migration files as `create_<name>_table`. And the reason why `--create=games` refers the flag 'games' as a plural is because of assumption that a table will contain multiple entries (hence plural) and a model being a single entry - another *Best Practices* of Laravel.


Now we open this migration file and edit as such following. Where the *schema* is the 'blueprint' of our table and dictates its very properties and where the `up()` function enables us to create or modify the table.
```
php

public function up(): void
{
    Schema::create('games', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('name');
        $table->string('genre');
        $table->integer('rating');
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```
To apply migration, we run `php artisan migrate` and if successful in our endeavour to TablePlus, we will see the `games` table in our database.


## 6. Seeding

A seeding is the actual thing that will insert data into our table. We create a seder file with this command:
```
bash

php artisan make:seeder GamesTableSeeder
```

We need to tell the `run()` function to insert data into `games` table which is done by the following code:
```
php

public function run(): void
{
    DB::table('games')->insert([
        [
        'name' => 'Minecraft', 
        'genre' => 'Sandbox', 
        'rating' => 7, 
        'created_at' => now(), 
        'updated_at' => now()
        ]
    ]);
}
```
Since we are using `DB::table('games')->insert()` method instead of the Eloquent model via `php artisan make:model Game`, we cannot automate the generation of the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields, hence we need to manually set it with `now()` function.

Take note that we need to import `DB` facade by adding this to the top of our code:
```
php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
```

Now we tell this *Machine Spirit* to run this seeder with `php artisan db:seed --class=GamesTableSeeder` command. Be noted that the `--class=` flag is optional; it's just there to specify which seeder to run.


## 7. Model

A model is in simplest terms, a data record in our table. It is not to be confused with a Seeding. Reason why we use a model is to usually specify `fillable` to avoid something called *Mass Assignment Exception* error. 

We create a model with this command: 
```
bash

php artisan make:model Game
```

Now, a mass assignment is, in simplest terms, a way to fill multiple data columns **at all once** instead of doing it manually. A mass assignment error occurs in due to lack of `fillable` property, not the *Machine Spirit's* fault, that Laravel doesn't know which columns are safe to be filled and which are not. In our Game model, we add this line:
```
php

protected $fillable = ['name', 'genre', 'rating'];
```


## 8. Testing

Tinker is a enviroment that allows us to test database with only command lines and bypass need to perform certain tasks like creating routes and controllers. We activate Tinker with the `php artisan tinker` command. As an example, to read with Tinker, we type `Game::all()`


## Appendix A

(A) [SUPERCEDED] Error -> `Driver error 20002: Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1'`

Solution [SUPERCEDED] -> Let the Omnimessiah guide your way to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` and make changes as following below. After that, restart by re-attempting to connect in TablePlus.
```
plaintext

127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
```

(B) [SUPERCEDED] Error -> You still cannot connect to the database.

Solution [SUPERCEDED] -> Open up your own development MySQL Server to circumvent the issue. Here's the rough list of configurations and steps:
```
plaintext

Choose Setup Type => Custom
MYSQL Server => Will be installed on local hard drive
Client Programs => Will be installed on local hard drive
Development Components => (No need to enable since you are using TablePlus)
Server Configuration Type => Development Computer
Port = 3306
X Protocol Port = 33060
Enable TCP/IP Networking => (You must enable this)
User account & Password => (You create your own here, just remember to update the .env file accordingly)
```
And here's the `.env` file configuration:
```
plaintext

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=a2p
DB_USERNAME=test
DB_PASSWORD=admin@12345678
```

(C) [SUPERCEDED] Error -> ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on localhost (10061) [^1]

Solution [SUPERCEDED] -> Make sure that MySQL server is running with the command `netstat -ano | findstr :3306`. If nothing shows up, start the server with `net start MySQL80` with Powershell as administrator. If this still does not work, then pray to the Machine God that the solution to Error (B) works if you haven't tried yet.

**(D) Error [NEWEST]** -> You cannot connect to the database with TablePlus

Solution [NEWEST] -> 

1) Uninstall mySQL server on your desktop to avoid port conflicts.

2) Close all DBngin servers then create a new server with simply putting a name and leaving everything else as default. 

3) Install `npm` and `breeze` with the following commands:
```
bash

npm install
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
```

3) Create a new server on DBNgin. Then, go to TablePlus and create a new connection with the following configuration:
```
plaintext

Name = AP2
Host/IP = 127.0.0.1
Port = 3306
User = root
Password = 
Database = 
```
**Note:** You MUST use `root` as the username and leave the password blank as that's DBNgin's default config. Do not have spaces in the `name` field to avoid future problems. Make sure to have the `.env` file reflect this change.

After saving and testing the connection, head to **Show Database List** via "Ctrl + K" and create a new database named `a2p` and open it. Your **table** dropdown tab should contain a list of database tables including the `games` table. If you don't see it, try refreshing the database and MAKE SURE you apply migration with `php artisan migrate` command.
